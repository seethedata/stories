We did work with a casino out West. As you can imagine, they have a number of goals such as identifying the lifetime value of a player or how to most effectively market their company to bring players into their building. In working with them, we helped them identify a data source that was incredibly insightful that they had never thought to use before - Zillow.com.  Our data scientists were able to help them construct an algorithm that coupled their in-house data with the Zillow data and identified not only that people from the same zip code liked  to play the same games but also that they played the games in the same way. For example, people from zip code 19460 like to play poker for an hour and a half or until they lose $500.  

By understanding this information, we were able to help them do some pretty cool things. For instance, we helped build a system that provided this zip code / preferences information to the pit bosses so they could monitor when they should attempt to intervene and comp a player (at the hour and fifteen minute mark, or when they lost $450). 

We also identified interesting up sell opportunities based on this data. When a player checks in at the hotel attached to the casino, they swipe their player card which provides their address information to the system. Very quickly, the system recognizes that this person is from a zip code that likes roulette and makes them an offer of $50 a day in roulette chips if they upgrade to a gold suite for $50 more per day. Based on the analytics, the likelihood is high that they accept the offer.

In addition, this casino had a data set they knew was valuable but they were unable to work with it. This was the evaluation of players by their wait staff, like the shoes or watch a player would be wearing or how generous their tipping would be. The wait staff would sometimes make notes on napkins about these things but this was unusable. We helped them by creating an iPad app that allowed the servers to handle their normal duties like collect drink orders and also provided a space for their notes on players. Now this this data was digitized, it was able to be included in the data analysis.

Over all, based on the work we did, this casino was able to realize an additional $40 million dollars a year.
