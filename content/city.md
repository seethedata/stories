A major metropolitan city's planners went to the city council to get approval to raise parking rates once again. The city council, however, asked “how do we know rates should be raised? What impact does this have on commerce? Why shouldn’t rates be lowered?” The parking policy team realized that they couldn’t point to anything beyond a “gut feeling” and “intuition.”
 
In order to adopt a more data-driven approach, they began paying a small army of observers, who every two years would be paid to stand on a block face for twenty-four hours and record every car that parked. What they found was incredible. In reality, there was no way of assessing what the actual inventory of available parking spaces was - since a Ford F-350 pickup truck or delivery truck could take up as many spaces as three Smart cars. To complicate matters, by local ordinance the handicapped could park without paying for parking, while other people were simply cheating the system and not paying when they should have. Thus, even smart meter data would be of little use in assessing actual parking demand.
 
When coupled with a large number of private parking structures, the data being gathered was completely inadequate. The goal set by the city council and the Neighborhood Business Districts was to have at least two parking spaces available on every block face during business hours. There were also implications far beyond retail activity. Up to 30% of city traffic during rush hour consisted of people simply circling the block looking for parking spaces. When this congestion backed up onto the freeways, traffic ground to a halt. The parking problem could actually be causing the city and the state hundreds of millions of dollars in road expansions aimed at alleviating the traffic congestion.
 
In the same city, grant money had been made available to a separate group to reduce single-occupancy vehicles to 25% of total traffic. However, they, like the parking policy team, had very little data at hand.
 
It later came to light that the City Operations Center was collecting detailed data from over-the-road sensors that could detect MAC IDs from mobile phones (a handy approximate of how many adults were in each car), license plate data from plate readers, meters on the on-ramps and off-ramps, and traffic cameras. This data was being used for managing traffic signals, but was then purged after every day, because it was “too expensive to keep.” 
 
In many cases, like the story above, not all the data that could be collected is being collected, much of the data being collected isn’t being kept, and the data being kept isn’t being made available for analysis, or being considered in analysis.
