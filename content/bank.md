A bank was working to determine the best possible placement for new ATMs, such that the additional ATMs would provide the maximum benefit to their customers who were currently underserved. After weeks of debate, someone in IT remembered that the new mobile app logs were kept, and included GPS data. After several attempts to explain the value of this to his colleagues, they finally understood that key to this challenge was that the mobile app had a feature where customers could request the location of the nearest ATM. The astute technologist filtered mobile app logs to show all requests to find a nearby ATM where the answer was in excess of three miles. Once that data was gathered, it was compared to ATM logs to show any cases where the user’s account wasn’t accessed in the subsequent hour. 
 
Within an hour, a map showed all locations where the bank’s customers had requested an ATM, been told none were within three miles, and had evidently visited another Bank’s ATMs. The clusters of dots clearly showed where new ATMs should optimally be located to best aid the bank’s customers. Meeting adjourned.
