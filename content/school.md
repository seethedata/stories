A charter school in Texas was looking to create something they called "Netflix for Teachers". You know how in Netflix it will say "You watched this movie - here are some other movies you might like"? They wanted to have recommendations like that for their teachers. This type of thing is very important as schools are always competing for the best teachers, and anything that can be provided to attract the top teachers is valuable.

We helped them by building an iPad app that provided all of the normal things like test scores and attendance for their students, however, we also provided each teach with advanced recommendations about things they could do to increase the performance of individual students. 

For example, one recommendation might say "Whenever you break the class up into groups, and you put Bobby and Jimmy in the same group, both their scores drop. They are friends and talk a lot. We recommend making sure they are in different groups." 

Another recommendation might be "Mary's math score is lower this week, but she doesn't need math help. You were working on word problems and she has reading comprehension trouble. Provide Mary with additional reading instruction."

We also made general recommendations about the relationship among the various subjects. For example, if you improve a student's math and writing scores, their science score also increases as a result. 

At the administration level, we also helped them create a data-driven approach to the use of grant money. The general idea is that the grant money should be applied to the project that is expected to increase student performance the most. For example, let's say there are three plans for how a certain grant was to be used - add 1,000 iPads to the classroom, provide specialized training to the teachers, or add one field trip to the agenda per semester. To make this decision, the expected impact on student performance was calculated as a score for each option, and the option with the highest score was the one that was funded.

Ultimately, providing teachers these advanced levels on insights about their students has become a reason to continue working at this school. In addition, student performance has also increased.
