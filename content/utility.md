A Canadian public utility was having issues with stolen power. The reason for this theft was that the authorities had gotten very good at identifying illegal drug growers by the abnormal amount of power that they required. To avoid getting caught, these growers would circumvent the power meters in the systems and siphon off the extra power they needed. This caused massive amounts of power loss every year for the utility. 

We were brought in to help find ways of identifying theft and fraud. By building a map of the electric system and calculating the expected amount of power at each meter, we were able to build a model that would identify abnormalities and assign them a score to indicate how likely the loss was due to theft.

The bottom line was that this model correctly identified fraud over 80% of the time and this resulting in the utility recoupig millions of dollars per year.
